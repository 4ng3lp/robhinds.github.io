Jekyll based CV page generator.

A few years agao I helped create a devloper CV app that let users sign up and connect their third party online footprints to make a dynamic online CV (formerly nerdability.com, now parked at: http://nerdability.esy.es/ ), and I thought why not just create a static site generator that could be nicely hosted on GitHub pages.

To make your own GitHub page CV:

1. Fork this repo into your github account 
2. Click the "Settings" button in your new forked repository (in the menu on the right), and change the repository's name to yourusername.github.io, replacing yourusername with your GitHub user name.
3. Update /_config.yml with the details of your CV
4. Visit http://{{yourusername}}.github.io to check it out!
